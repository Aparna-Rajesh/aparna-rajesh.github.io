    <h3>Specialization for the Space</h3>
    <p>The bottom portion of the display was broken, disrupting the flow of the visual narrative. But I tried to embrace the imperfection as a metaphor for the fractured nature of the human experience.</p>
    <p>Incorporating the hanging structure into the metaphor, the piece can be interpreted as a symbol for navigating the currents of time and space. As the device twists and twirls under the air vent, it invites viewers to reflect on the fluidity of existence and the transient nature of our journey through life.</p>

    <h3>Creative Decisions</h3>
    <p>As students, we oscillate between moments of reassurance and moments of doubt, caught in a perpetual daily cycle of striving and questioning.</p>
    <p>Central to this project was the concept of a 24-second loop.</p>
    <p>The loop's structure serves as a microcosm of the temporal constraints and emotional fluctuations we endure throughout the day. 60% of the time is dedicated to plastering the words "It'll be okay" across the screen, representing a student's attempt at calming themselves. But these messages are repeatedly interrupted (at random) by anxiety-riddled messages (selected at random) that ultimately take up 20% of the 24-second loop.</p>
    <p>Only 10% of the loop is dedicated to respite (the ESP enters deep sleep during this time) from the constant ebb and flow of stress, underscoring the fleeting nature of solace.</p>
    <p>The intentional imbalance mirrors the internal struggles of many students who are navigating the tumultuous currents of academic and personal life.</p>
    <p>There's a poignant risk embedded within the designâ€”an imbalance in energy expenditure that will ultimately cause the ESP to run out of battery before the display is taken down.</p>
    <p>The disproportionate allocation of energy toward anxiety and attempts at reassurance serves as a metaphor for the delicate balance between emotional resilience and vulnerability and the risk of never finding balance.</p>
    <p>It's a stark reminder of the fact that many of the resources at our disposal are finite, and as a result, it highlights the importance of mindful energy management.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I also took color into consideration. In contrast to the vibrant colors used for the calming messages, the anxiety-inducing phrases are deliberately in black and white. It's meant to reflect the starkness and clarity with which anxiety can sometimes manifest in our lives, devoid of the colorful nuances that characterize moments of comfort and reassurance.</p>
    <p>I also intentionally placed the anxious messages towards the bottom right corner of the display to serve as a visual metaphor for the creeping presence of anxiety, lurking at the periphery of our consciousness and gradually encroaching upon our thoughts and emotions.</p>

    <h3>Technical Issues Encountered</h3>
    <p>Configuring the TFT display and managing its backlight intensity required some experimentation. Synchronizing the display of messages with precise timing also took some testing and refinement.</p>

    <p>The most notable issue was getting the ESP to show up my Arduino IDE, which proved to be a significant roadblock in the initial stages of the project.</p>
    <p>After some digging, I stumbled upon a tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8254--ibmM">YouTube</a>, which provided invaluable insights into resolving the issue.</p>
    <p>It's also crucial to have a good USBC connection, and it may help to have <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads">this driver</a> installed.</p>

    <h2>README</h2>
    <p>Follow these instructions to create a similar generative art display using an ESP32 microcontroller and a TFT display that alternates between soothing messages and anxiety-inducing phrases, reflecting the ebb and flow of human emotion within a 24-second loop.</p>

    <h3>ESP Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Install the Arduino IDE from the official website.</li>
        <li>Install the ESP32 board support package in the Arduino IDE. Follow the instructions <a href="https://youtu.be/adLUgmCJKnM">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Install the TFT_eSPI library by Bodmer. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries..., search for "TFT_eSPI" and install it.</li>
        <li>Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.</li>
        <li>Open <a href="https://github.com/Aparna-Rajesh/CES-Module1/blob/main/mod1_01.ino">the code</a> provided in the Arduino IDE.</li>
        <li>Upload the code to your ESP32 board.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After uploading the code, the generative art display will start running immediately. The display alternates between soothing messages, displayed in random colors, and anxiety-inducing phrases, displayed in black and white towards the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
    <p>The display operates within a 24-second loop, with 60% of the time dedicated to soothing messages, 20% to anxiety-inducing phrases, and 10% to deep sleep mode to conserve power.</p>

    <h3>Building the Display</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use heat shrink to build a battery setup (with a 130mAh battery) that will be compatible with the board. Remember that black wires should never be connected with red wires!</li>
        <img src="battery.jpeg" 
            width="300" 
            height=auto />
        <li>Connect the battery to the board.</li>
        <img src="connectedbattery.jpeg" 
            width="300" 
            height=auto />
        <li>Design an envelope with a rectangular hole in the center for the ESP display. Write calming messages in different colors horizontally across the envelope; in smaller letters, add anxious messages in black letters vertically towards the bottom. </li>
        <img src="envelope.JPG" 
            width="300" 
            height=auto />
        <li>Poke a small hole in a popsicle stick and string a thread through the hole. Tie one end of the string to the popsicle stick. Wrap the string around the width of the popsicle stick and tie it again. The majority of the string should hang from the popsicle stick.</li>
        <img src="string.JPG" 
            width="300" 
            height=auto />
        <li>Poke a small hole in the envelope and pull the string through the hole and tie it. The envelope should be hanging from the popsicle stick.</li>
        <img src="strungenvelope.jpeg" 
            width="300" 
            height=auto />
        <li>Use tape to fasten the ESP (the display should poke out a bit through the rectangular hole in the paper) and the battery inside the envelope and seal it shut.</li>
        <img src="envelopewithesp.jpeg" 
        width="300"

        <li>Place the popsicle stick between beams underneath the air vent on the 5th floor lounge in Milstein.</li>
